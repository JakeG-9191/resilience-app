##Issue Body
 - Break problem into segments that make it easy for developer or QA team member to replicate
    - What is the issue?
    - How did I get to issue?
    - What enviornment was issue discovered on?
        *local with new master pull, Heroku deployment, ect.*
    - If applicable, add a screen shot or two to help speed up process of replication
**In many cases, there should be a detailed list within the body so QA or devs do not need to reach out for additional information, more detailed issues will help all team members in the long run**

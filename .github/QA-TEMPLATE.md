# QA Issues Template

---

## Issue Title

- Should be short but capture essence of issue within a few key words

_Clicking on X Component Redirects User_

## Issue Body

- Break problem into segments that make it easy for developer or QA team member to replicate
  - What is the issue?
  - How did I get to issue?
  - What enviornment was issue discovered on?
    _local with new master pull, Heroku deployment, ect._
  - If applicable, add a screen shot or two to help speed up process of replication

**In many cases, there should be a detailed list within the body so QA or devs do not need to reach out for additional information, more detailed issues will help all team members in the long run**

_Naviagate to Y Landing Page_
_Click on X component and note that user is redirected_
_Issue discovered while running application locally with master branch pull from 5/19/20_
_Insert Z screenshot that covers X Component_
